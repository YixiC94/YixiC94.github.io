I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in Management (Organization Theory) at Columbia Business School. I received my M.A. in Social Sciences (Sociology) from the University of Chicago and my B.A. in History and Economics from Mount Holyoke College. 

My research sits at the intersection of **stigma**, **narrative**, and **social** **evaluation**. I examine how individuals strategically present their stigmatized identities in evaluative settings and how stigmatized identities can shift from being perceived as liabilities to being seen as assets. I investigate the forms and consequences of revealing versus concealing devalued identities, such as lower social class, incarceration records, and neurodivergence, across contexts ranging from elite education to entrepreneurship. I examine conditions under which revealing stigma in venture narratives, counterintuitively, increases venture distinctiveness and worth, rather than undermining them. I use a mixed-method approach, combining experiments with interviews, computational text analysis, and surveys. 

Before coming to Columbia, I worked as a Senior Analyst at Mastercard International (New York and Shanghai) and as a pre-doctoral researcher at the Berkeley Cultural Lab. Outside of work, I enjoy playing fetch with my dog in Central Park, traveling, and reading science fiction.
