I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in Management (Organization Theory) at Columbia Business School. I received my M.A. in Social Sciences (Sociology) from the University of Chicago and my B.A. in History and Economics from Mount Holyoke College. 

My research sits at the intersection of stigma, narrative, and evaluation. I ask how individuals strategically present their stigmatized identities in evaluative settings and how stigmatized identities can shift from being perceived as liabilities to being seen as assets. In my dissertation,  I examine two important yet understudied populations--entrepreneurs with incarceration histories and those with neurodivergent conditions. I examine how these founders strategically construct and communicate their identity narratives to investors and how different identity disclosure strategies shape perceptions of legitimacy, distinctiveness, and worth. I leverage experiments combined with interviews, surveys, and computational text analysis to uncover how foundersâ€™ stigma disclosure strategies shape audience evaluations. Beyond my dissertation, I study how individuals present their lower social class and gender identities and the consequences on their professional networks and performances. 

Before coming to Columbia, I worked as a Senior Analyst at Mastercard International (New York and Shanghai) and as a pre-doctoral researcher at the Berkeley Cultural Lab. Outside of work, I enjoy playing fetch with my dog in Central Park, traveling, and reading science fiction.
